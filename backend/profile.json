  "about": "Hybrid software engineer and systems specialist with 7+ years across Python/C++ development, Unreal Engine tooling, and IT operations. I automate end‑to‑end workflows—from OPSI‑driven Windows/Linux fleet management and Flexera license servers to custom RFID‑backed worker management and Arduino/Raspberry Pi devices. Experienced supporting simulation stacks (SIMULIA, MICRESS, Dragonfly, Inventor), building scalable services, and migrating workloads to AWS/Azure. Track record: −40% costs via cloud migration and −25% bugs through test automation. I thrive where I can ship robust tools, reduce toil, and unlock team productivity.",
